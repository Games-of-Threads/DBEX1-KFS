# Database excercise 1 (Key-Value Stores)
This is for the first database assignment related to key-value storage,

## how to use
### step 1.   
Have windows running either on a virtual machine or base.
### step 2.   
download the this repository either with a browser or git commands through terminal
### step 3.   
Navigate to the release folder from the root folder and execute the program.
(note I'm unsure if it's needed but .NET framework may be needed other than the base windows, but don't think about it until you experience errors)
### step 4.   
Engage with the system

#### Commands
text commands from base is the following.
```
add
check
exit
```
every command is executed with a enter key, and some commands have a press a key to continue without a prompt to allow overview.
#### add
this commands allows you to add new people entries to the system, it follows a strict structure that goes as follows.   
first you give it the index key, this can be 0 but I recommend choosing any positive integer.   
second it ask for a name, comply with a string name, please don't use ; or [ or ] :(   
third it as for a status, comply like previously.   
You succesfully added a person if you followed this correctly.

#### check
input the integer of the entry you wish to check, input 0 if you wish to check all.   

#### exit
this exits the application with a little bye bye! note.
